            <h2>Hey Tharushi,</h2>
            <p>As the title suggests, I'm here to ask you a question that has been on my mind for a while now. Would you do me the incredible honor of being my Valentine?</p>
            <p>I mean like we have exams and stuff and like u wld probably be learning sm and stuff but I know that spending this day with you as my valentine would make this day very special , idk its just ur presence and everything... I mean like I totally understand if you have other plans and you like already told yes to someone but I cldnt let this oppurtunity slide just cuz of that .</p>
            <p>Here, I've outlined my dream for our Valentine's Day. From a romantic dinner to a moonlit walk, every detail is carefully thought out to make it a day to remember. So like. if one day I do get to spend valentine's with you. physically and without having the risk of getting caught and blablabla... sooooo first of all this is a hypothetical situation where I am hoping that you did say yes. So I would start by bringing you flowers cuz like what is valentines day without well.. flowers.. anddddddd chocolates... and I would well ask you out for a dinner. at a private place where no one else would be there. Id make reservations and blablabla and then there would be a romantic and at the same time a really beautiful card asking you out for dinner at your doorstep and well ud obviously come and I would arrange a realllly expensive taxi . to pick you up cuz like idw see u untillll wer in the restaurant andd well meet up to the place i thought of.. and oh my u would look STUNNING cuz I imagine u wearing a really really woah dress and ud just look stunning and well this place is more of like a hotel where we have a stay at. and Id first of all surprise you with a bouqet of flowers and take you to the dining table which wld be fillllled with candles and fresh flowers and there wld be like music playing in the background.. First like calm music and after like everything we can move to chase atlantic :)) if ukwis... anyways after dinner id take you to the beach.. which is like right in front of us.. basically wer having dinner at a coastal side .. but its just us... wed walk under the night sky filled with stars and it wld be like the most perfect evening and we would hold hands and walk to the beach and we would like go up to the shore where there are like waves splashing towards our legs and our clothes wld be fully wet and then I would take you to the hotel . to our bedroom and then wellllllll lets just say you would die.. in there :))</p>

</p>So, what do you say, Tharushi? Will you take a chance on me and make this Valentine's Day one to remember?</p>
